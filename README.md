This project implements an interactive star rating system that allows the user to select a rating by clicking on stars. The system visually displays the rating level by coloring the stars according to the selected item.

Key Features
Star Reset:

When the user interacts with the stars, all stars are first reset to a default gray color. This allows previously selected stars to be disabled before reapplying the new selection.
Star Coloring:

Depending on the star clicked, all previous stars are colored in a distinctive color (e.g. purple) to indicate the rating. The number of stars colored depends on the star clicked.
A class management system is used to apply a specific visual style to each selected star.
User Interaction:

Each star is clickable, and depending on the star the user clicks, the rating is changed. If the user clicks on an already selected star again, it will "unselect" some stars and return them to the default color.
Responsive behavior:

The color and state of the stars change dynamically upon user interaction, providing immediate visual feedback.
Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simple star rating system where users can assign a visual rating based on the number of colored stars, while allowing the rating to be reset and changed intuitively.
